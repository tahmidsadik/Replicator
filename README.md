## Replicator
Bootstrapped ClojureScript REPL for Android  
Heavily inspired by [Replete](https://github.com/mfikes/replete).   
Currently using Rhino as the javascript engine but will move to JavaScriptCore later.  

## Running
1.Just Open the project in Android Studio and run the app on a device or simulator (`Make sure you use Geny Motion for best performance`)
