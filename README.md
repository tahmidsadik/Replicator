## Replicator
Bootstrapped ClojureScript REPL for Android  
Heavily inspired by [Replete](https://github.com/mfikes/replete).   
Currently using V8 as the javascript engine but will move to JavaScriptCore eventually.  

## Running
Just Open the project in Android Studio and run the app on a device or simulator (`Make sure you use Geny Motion for best performance`)

##Contributing
Pull requests are welcome!
Currently I need help with getting JSCore to work with Android.

##Thanks
[Mike Fikes](https://github.com/mfikes) for guiding me and helping me.
